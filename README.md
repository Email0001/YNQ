Yes, No or another Question

1. What is the philosophy behind this project?

  Inspired by Wolframe's book, "A New Kind Of Science", complexity could come from simple rule.
  Do we find the simple rule that can generate complexity?
  I want this project to be based on simple rule and persistantly generate complexity effects.

2. What is the simple rule of this project?

  You have three choices: respond to others' question with 'Y', respond to others' question with 'N' or ask another question.

  And it's better to follow Twitter's established simple rule: keep your question in 140 words.

3. What is the problem this project want to solve?

  The information society is becoming overloaded noisily wordy.
  People respond quickly without holding on thinking.
  If we want to think more, understand more, we need to ask more questions.

(4) What is the right answer?
Unlike shoes and clothes once bought the right one, there is no need to keep buying, questions need to keep questioning instead of stoping at the right answer.
